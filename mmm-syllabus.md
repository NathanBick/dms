**Syllabus**

**EN.500.111 Section 9**

**Melding Mind and Machine:**

**Exploring Neurotechnologies that Can Read Our Minds and Alter Our
Brains**

**Fall, 2014**

**(1 credit)**

**Description**

In this course, we will explore technological developments which have
allowed us to measure and manipulate brain activity. In the first part
of the course, we will study brain computer interfaces that record
signals from the brain and use those signals to perform a task. We will
cover the basic principles of such devices and review the cutting-edge
research that is being conducted at Hopkins as well as around the world.
In the second part of the course, we will study neuromodulation
technologies. These technologies will include transcranial magnetic
stimulation, deep brain stimulation, and optogenetics. We will explore
how neuromodulation has been used as both a tool to study the brain and
a treatment for brain disorders.

**Course Expectations & Grading**

This course is graded Pass/Fail (S/U). Attendance is mandatory. Please
let the instructor know if you will miss a class. Your grade will be
determined based on attendance and class participation. We will have
many discussions, so there will be plenty of opportunities for
participation. There will be assigned readings/videos each week. Come to
class prepared to discuss that week's topic.
